## VELO: VErtex LOcator {#VELO}

[Twiki](https://lbtwiki.cern.ch/bin/view/VELO) for the VELO project.

## VeloPix {#VeloPix}

The [ASIC](a.md#ASIC) for reading out the [VELO](v.md#VELO) pixel sensors for LHCb Upgrade I. Adapted from the [Timepix3](t.md#Timepix3) chip but with alterations such as a super pixel structure (group pixels into 8-pixel arrays since multi-pixel hits are likely with the 55x55 micron pixels) and stripped back timing information to reduce bandwidth to enable it to cope with a higher occupancy at full LHC rate.

## VO: Virtual Organisation {#VO}

Each LHC experiment is a VO by means of which users are centrally managed for example for authorisations in the WLCG infrastructure.
