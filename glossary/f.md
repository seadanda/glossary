## Flavour Tagging {#flavourtagging}

(In LHCb typically) Determination of the sign of the bottomness of a meson at production. I.e. if it was a B or an anti-B at production.

## FPGA: Field Programmable Gate Array {#FPGA}

An integrated circuit which can be thought of as a reprogrammable [ASIC](a.md#ASIC). It consists of banks of logic which has configurable connections, analagous to logic gates which can be physically connected with wires. By connecting these logic blocks together in different ways, different functions can be achieved using the same chip. Abstractisations exist such that code can be written in [HDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language), which reads like a regular programming language, and can then be synthesised to the corresponding connections of logic blocks. An advantage of implementing an algorithm on FPGAs instead of CPUs or GPUs is the high clock frequencies (~hundreds of GHz) and capabilities for massive parallelisation, which makes them perfect candidates for detector readout and clustering.
